# Introduction to Go

Go is a simple but powerful alternative to c++ and other web server languages. Go (or Golang) is a reimagination of c++ but with a focus on current language needs. Go is used a lot in enterprise, Kubernetes, Netflix and Github all use Go. It was written by a group of devs at Google and is Open Source.

## Setup
Installing go is just as easy as node or python. Go to https://golang.org/dl/, download and install. Next we need to setup an IDE. The most popular are VSCode, vim, and GoLand (jetbrains). I'm going to use VSCode sense it is the most popular.
